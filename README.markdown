Started on a cold winter night in October 08'. Its a simple sparkline graph, but you should be able to drop it straight in. 
Next time I need to drop some sparklines / graphs into a project I'm sure it'll get some attention. Until then...eehhh. Send patches!

Open `example/sparkline.html` in your browser to run the example shown below.

## Thanks

* Dylan Egan, for tooling about and making the sparklines look a better
* Edward Tufte, for designing sparklines
